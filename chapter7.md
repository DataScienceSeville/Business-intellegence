>=============================================
> - *Data remains the most critical ingredient of successful analytical capabilities 
  The evolution of data collection and infrastructure systems can be
  traced back to the early 1990’s when ERP systems started gaining prominence.*
> - *These ERP systems link corporate databases to support various business processes
 like Sales, HR, finance, Customer Service etc.*
> - *This also coincided with the launch of PC (Personal Computer)
 reporting solutions like Crystal Reports, Microstrategy EIS Toolkit, Qlik
Technologies*
> - *The Y2K (Year 2000) phenomenon1 served to acceleraten this ERP “migration” as companies scrambled to revamp IT systems to identify and eliminate the Y2K bug.*
> - *ERP systems offered a “off the shelf” solution that improved the IT and Data infrastructure while also eliminating the Y2K challenges of legacy systems.*
> - *The rising growth of the Internet as a commercial platform, coupled with the
ever reducing cost of storage, and growth of computational capabilities significantly
accelerated the rate and scope of data collection.*
> - *BI Vendors : A slew of vendors started selling a variety of solutions that could collect, collate
and query and retrieve large volumes of data very efficiently.*
> - *The 2000s: As organizations began to come to terms with the richness and volume
of data that was available, sophisticated analytical techniques for forecasting
and predictive modeling began to become feasible.*
>- *The ecosystem started to see two very distinct phenomena.*
> -                 *The growth of specialized vendors who provided services in the area of statistical
and mathematical modeling.*
> -                 *The logical extension of the BI Vendors rebranding as “Analytics Solution
Providers” by leveraging their data infrastructure and add value added features
and services on top.*
