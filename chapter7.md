>=============================================
> - *Data remains the most critical ingredient of successful analytical capabilities 
  The evolution of data collection and infrastructure systems can be
  traced back to the early 1990’s when ERP systems started gaining prominence.*
> - *These ERP systems link corporate databases to support various business processes
 like Sales, HR, finance, Customer Service etc.*
> - *This also coincided with the launch of PC (Personal Computer)
 reporting solutions like Crystal Reports, Microstrategy EIS Toolkit, Qlik
Technologies*
> - *The Y2K (Year 2000) phenomenon1 served to acceleraten this ERP “migration” as companies scrambled to revamp IT systems to identify and eliminate the Y2K bug.*
> - *ERP systems offered a “off the shelf” solution that improved the IT and Data infrastructure while also eliminating the Y2K challenges of legacy systems.*
> - *The rising growth of the Internet as a commercial platform, coupled with the
ever reducing cost of storage, and growth of computational capabilities significantly
accelerated the rate and scope of data collection.*
> - **BI Vendors** :*A slew of vendors started selling a variety of solutions that could collect, collate
and query and retrieve large volumes of data very efficiently.*
> - *The 2000s: As organizations began to come to terms with the richness and volume
of data that was available, sophisticated analytical techniques for forecasting
and predictive modeling began to become feasible.*
>
> **The ecosystem started to see two very distinct phenomena.** 
>
 1.                 *The growth of specialized vendors who provided services in the area of statistical
and mathematical modeling.*
 2.                *The logical extension of the BI Vendors rebranding as “Analytics Solution
Providers” by leveraging their data infrastructure and add value added features
and services on top.*
>
**“Analytics”**
 was defined and redefined frequently
and usually to suit the convenience of the people spending the most money*
>
> **some symptoms seen (up to) today become obvious**
  1. A large number BI projects fail—a recent Gartner study estimated that less than
30 % of BI projects were deemed to meet the needs of the Business.
  2. Funding for analytics and BI initiatives will be less dependent on IT budgets,
but rather on Business Units to drive the analytics that they need.
  3. Companies that involve the Business Users in their BI initiative show more success
that those who do not.

>=============================================
The evolution of BI data infrastructure can be put into three stages:
 1. Single-Pass Analytics Systems:This design imagines a situation where data flows linearly from OLTP
to BI to the reports used by analysts. In this case, the data flow looks like it hits a “dead end” in the analyses.
 2. Overlapped Analytics Systems (Single-Pass and Looped)—in the real
world, analysts get data from various systems (not just the official BI databases)
and process it in their own analyses that are provided to decision makers,affairs,this
creates data loops, which manifest downstream in overlapping and conflicting
reports.
 3. Closed-Loop Analytics Systems:This stage aligns the data-flows and data-stores in support of the analytics
function, and avoids the loops and overlaps in the previous stage,There is a huge conflict in the second stage between analysts who continuously evolve their own models and their IT counterparts who encode models into the
databases and data flows in the form of database designs,this conflict is resolved by separating the concept of input data
(stored in a “Data Arrival Stage”) and model data (stored in “Business Analytics
Databases”).
